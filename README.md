## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I want to countine my learning of html and css so that I can have a better understanding of web development. I plan on moving on to javascript after making a couple more websites. I hope to be able to become a frontend developer.

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://flexbox.malven.co/) - This website gave me a simple referecne to flexboxes that I could look back on quickly.
- [resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - Since I am learning Css over again, this was a helpful resource for looking up things that I forgot.
